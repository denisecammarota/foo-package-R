# foo

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of foo is to exemplify the creation of an R package. In this case, this package has only a function called 'my_shannon' that calculates the Shannon diversity index from a vector. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of foo like so:

```{r}
remotes::install_github("denisecammarota/foo-package-R")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(foo)
shannon_index <- my_shannon(c(1,2,3)) #calculate shannon diversity index
```
